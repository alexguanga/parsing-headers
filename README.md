Parsing Headers
=========

This script was created to create a table of contents. For some repos, I learned that it's hard to know what's in every subdirectory. 
Even worse, if there are Jupyter Notebooks in a subdirectory, I have difficult time knowing the subject of every Notebook.

Fortunately, I use "Headers" in my Notebook. Using the "Headers," this script will create a table of contents (in markdown) using the 
"Headers" type. For example:
	- If the headers of a Notebook are "Machine Learning Types" (Header 1) broken into different subheaders like Random Forest or Linear Regression, 
the subheaders will be sub-topics in the table of contents.
